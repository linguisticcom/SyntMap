# SyntMap
ESL web app
VISION For English language learners who want a fresh start through a simplified visualization of language patterns, and recommended learning path. The SYNTAX MAP is an online language learning app which offers a visual representation of the language syntax, and of their learning progress. Unlike existing solutions not only does the SYNTAX MAP offer a hollistic visual mapping of English language phenomena, but it also allows the learner to customise or contribute their representation to maximise retention and ultimately mastery.
